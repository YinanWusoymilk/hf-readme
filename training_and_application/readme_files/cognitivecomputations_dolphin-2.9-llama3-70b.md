A bug has been found in the Dolphin 2.9 dataset in SystemConversations that causes the model to overly talk about the "SYSTEM MESSAGE".  To counter this, we recommend you add a statement in the system message directing the model not to mention the system message. An example system message is "The assistant is named Dolphin.  A helpful and friendly AI assistant, Dolphin avoids discussing the system message unless directly asked about it."

Our appreciation for the sponsors of Dolphin 2.9:
- [Crusoe Cloud](https://crusoe.ai/) - provided excellent on-demand 8xH100 node

This model is based on Llama-3-70b, and is governed by [META LLAMA 3 COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT](LICENSE)

The base model has 8k context, and the qLoRA fine-tuning was with 8k sequence length.

It took 2.5 days on 8xH100 node provided by Crusoe Cloud

This model uses ChatML prompt template format.

example:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are Dolphin, a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Dolphin-2.9 has a variety of instruction, conversational, and coding skills. It also has initial agentic abilities and supports function calling.

Dolphin is uncensored. I have filtered the dataset to remove alignment and bias. This makes the model more compliant. You are advised to implement your own alignment layer before exposing the model as a service. It will be highly compliant with any requests, even unethical ones. Please read my blog post about uncensored models. https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models You are responsible for any content you create using this model. Enjoy responsibly.

Dolphin is licensed according to Meta's Llama license.  I grant permission for any use, including commercial, that falls within accordance with Meta's Llama-3 license.  Dolphin was trained on data generated from GPT4, among other models.
