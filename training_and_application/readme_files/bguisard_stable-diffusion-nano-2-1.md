# Stable Diffusion Nano 2.1

Stable Diffusion Nano was built during the [JAX/Diffusers community sprint ðŸ§¨](https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/jax-controlnet-sprint#jaxdiffusers-community-sprint-).

Based on stable diffusion and fine-tuned on 128x128 images, Stable Diffusion Nano
allows for fast prototyping of diffusion models, enabling quick experimentation
with easily available hardware.

It performs reasonably well on several tasks, but it struggles with small details
such as faces.

## Training details
All parameters were initialized from the [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base)
model. The unet was fine tuned as follows:

U-net fine-tuning:
- 200,000 steps, learning rate = 1e-5, batch size = 992 (248 per TPU).
- 100,000 steps, SNR gamma = 5.0, learning rate = 1e-5, batch size = 992 (248 per TPU).
- Trained on [LAION Improved Aesthetics 6plus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChristophSchuhmann/improved_aesthetics_6plus).
