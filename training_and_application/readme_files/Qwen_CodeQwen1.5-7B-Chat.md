# CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat


## Introduction

CodeQwen1.5 is the Code-Specific version of Qwen1.5. It is a transformer-based decoder-only language model pretrained on a large amount of data of codes. 

* Strong code generation capabilities and competitve performance across a series of benchmarks;
* Supporting long context understanding and generation with the context length of 64K tokens;
* Supporting 92 coding languages
* Excellent performance in text-to-SQL, bug fix, etc.


For more details, please refer to our [blog post](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/codeqwen1.5/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen1.5).

## Model Details
CodeQwen1.5 is based on Qwen1.5, a language model series including decoder language models of different model sizes. It is trained on 3 trillion tokens of data of codes, and it includes group query attention (GQA) for efficient inference.


## Requirements
The code of Qwen1.5 has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to install `transformers>=4.37.0`, or you might encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'.
```

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat")

prompt = "Write a quicksort algorithm in python."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```



## Tips

* If you encounter code switching or other bad cases, we advise you to use our provided hyper-parameters in `generation_config.json`.
