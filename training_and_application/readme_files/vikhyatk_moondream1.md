# ðŸŒ” moondream1

1.6B parameter model built by [@vikhyatk](https://x.com/vikhyatk) using SigLIP, Phi-1.5 and the LLaVa training dataset.
The model is release for research purposes only, commercial use is not allowed.

Try it out on [Huggingface Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vikhyatk/moondream1)!

**Usage**

```
pip install transformers timm einops
```

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, CodeGenTokenizerFast as Tokenizer
from PIL import Image

model_id = "vikhyatk/moondream1"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

image = Image.open('<IMAGE_PATH>')
enc_image = model.encode_image(image)
print(model.answer_question(enc_image, "<QUESTION>", tokenizer))
```
