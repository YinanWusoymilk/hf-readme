## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers Installation

First install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors --upgrade
```

Then run image generation with the following example code:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.1", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    use_safetensors=True, 
)
pipe.to('cuda')

prompt = "1girl, souryuu asuka langley, neon genesis evangelion, solo, upper body, v, smile, looking at viewer, outdoors, night"
negative_prompt = "nsfw, lowres, (bad), text, error, fewer, extra, missing, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, low quality, watermark, unfinished, displeasing, oldest, early, chromatic aberration, signature, extra digits, artistic error, username, scan, [abstract]"

image = pipe(
    prompt, 
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=832,
    height=1216, 
    guidance_scale=7,
    num_inference_steps=28
).images[0]

image.save("./output/asuka_test.png")
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Tag Ordering

For optimal results, it's recommended to follow the structured prompt template because we train the model like this:

```
1girl/1boy, character name, from what series, everything else in any order.
```

## Special Tags

Animagine XL 3.1 utilizes special tags to steer the result toward quality, rating, creation date and aesthetic. While the model can generate images without these tags, using them can help achieve better results.

### Quality Modifiers

Quality tags now consider both scores and post ratings to ensure a balanced quality distribution. We've refined labels for greater clarity, such as changing 'high quality' to 'great quality'.

| Quality Modifier | Score Criterion   |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `masterpiece`    | > 95%             |
| `best quality`   | > 85% & â‰¤ 95%     |
| `great quality`  | > 75% & â‰¤ 85%     |
| `good quality`   | > 50% & â‰¤ 75%     |
| `normal quality` | > 25% & â‰¤ 50%     |
| `low quality`    | > 10% & â‰¤ 25%     |
| `worst quality`  | â‰¤ 10%             |

### Rating Modifiers

We've also streamlined our rating tags for simplicity and clarity, aiming to establish global rules that can be applied across different models. For example, the tag 'rating: general' is now simply 'general', and 'rating: sensitive' has been condensed to 'sensitive'. 

| Rating Modifier   | Rating Criterion |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `safe`            | General          |
| `sensitive`       | Sensitive        |
| `nsfw`            | Questionable     |
| `explicit, nsfw`  | Explicit         |

### Year Modifier

We've also redefined the year range to steer results towards specific modern or vintage anime art styles more accurately. This update simplifies the range, focusing on relevance to current and past eras.

| Year Tag | Year Range       |
|----------|------------------|
| `newest` | 2021 to 2024     |
| `recent` | 2018 to 2020     |
| `mid`    | 2015 to 2017     |
| `early`  | 2011 to 2014     |
| `oldest` | 2005 to 2010     |

### Aesthetic Tags

We've enhanced our tagging system with aesthetic tags to refine content categorization based on visual appeal. These tags are derived from evaluations made by a specialized ViT (Vision Transformer) image classification model, specifically trained on anime data. For this purpose, we utilized the model [shadowlilac/aesthetic-shadow-v2](https://huggingface.co/shadowlilac/aesthetic-shadow-v2), which assesses the aesthetic value of content before it undergoes training. This ensures that each piece of content is not only relevant and accurate but also visually appealing.

| Aesthetic Tag     | Score Range       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `very aesthetic`  | > 0.71            |
| `aesthetic`       | > 0.45 & < 0.71   |
| `displeasing`     | > 0.27 & < 0.45   |
| `very displeasing`| â‰¤ 0.27            |

## Recommended settings

To guide the model towards generating high-aesthetic images, use negative prompts like:

```
nsfw, lowres, (bad), text, error, fewer, extra, missing, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, low quality, watermark, unfinished, displeasing, oldest, early, chromatic aberration, signature, extra digits, artistic error, username, scan, [abstract]
```

For higher quality outcomes, prepend prompts with:

```
masterpiece, best quality, very aesthetic, absurdres
```

itâ€™s recommended to use a lower classifier-free guidance (CFG Scale) of around 5-7, sampling steps below 30, and to use Euler Ancestral (Euler a) as a sampler. 

### Multi Aspect Resolution

This model supports generating images at the following dimensions:

| Dimensions        | Aspect Ratio    |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `1024 x 1024`     | 1:1 Square      |
| `1152 x 896`      | 9:7             |
| `896 x 1152`      | 7:9             |
| `1216 x 832`      | 19:13           |
| `832 x 1216`      | 13:19           |
| `1344 x 768`      | 7:4 Horizontal  |
| `768 x 1344`      | 4:7 Vertical    |
| `1536 x 640`      | 12:5 Horizontal |
| `640 x 1536`      | 5:12 Vertical   |

## Training and Hyperparameters

**Animagine XL 3.1** was trained on 2x A100 80GB GPUs for approximately 15 days, totaling over 350 GPU hours. The training process consisted of three stages:
  - **Pretraining**: Utilized a data-rich collection of 870k ordered and tagged images to increase Animagine XL 3.0's model knowledge.
  - **Finetuning - First Stage**: Employed labeled and curated aesthetic datasets to refine the broken U-Net after pretraining.
  - **Finetuning - Second Stage**: Utilized labeled and curated aesthetic datasets to refine the model's art style and improve hand and anatomy rendering.

## Limitations

While Animagine XL 3.1 represents a significant advancement in anime-style image generation, it is important to acknowledge its limitations:

1. **Anime-Focused**: This model is specifically designed for generating anime-style images and is not suitable for creating realistic photos. 
2. **Prompt Complexity**: This model may not be suitable for users who expect high-quality results from short or simple prompts. The training focus was on concept understanding rather than aesthetic refinement, which may require more detailed and specific prompts to achieve the desired output.
3. **Prompt Format**: Animagine XL 3.1 is optimized for Danbooru-style tags rather than natural language prompts. For best results, users are encouraged to format their prompts using the appropriate tags and syntax.
4. **Anatomy and Hand Rendering**: Despite the improvements made in anatomy and hand rendering, there may still be instances where the model produces suboptimal results in these areas. 
5. **Dataset Size**: The dataset used for training Animagine XL 3.1 consists of approximately 870,000 images. When combined with the previous iteration's dataset (1.2 million), the total training data amounts to around 2.1 million images. While substantial, this dataset size may still be considered limited in scope for an "ultimate" anime model.
6. **NSFW Content**: Animagine XL 3.1 has been designed to generate more balanced NSFW content. However, it is important to note that the model may still produce NSFW results, even if not explicitly prompted. 

By acknowledging these limitations, we aim to provide transparency and set realistic expectations for users of Animagine XL 3.1. Despite these constraints, we believe that the model represents a significant step forward in anime-style image generation and offers a powerful tool for artists, designers, and enthusiasts alike.
