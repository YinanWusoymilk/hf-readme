*üëæ [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) Community models highlights program. Highlighting new & noteworthy models by the community. Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aPQfnNkxGC)*.

**Model creator:** [DeepSeek](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai)<br>
**Original model**: [DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct)<br>
**GGUF quantization:** provided by [bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) based on `llama.cpp` release [b3166](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b3166)<br>

## Model Settings:

Requires LM Studio 0.2.25, update can be downloaded from here: https://lmstudio.ai

Flash attention MUST be **disabled** for this model to work.

## Model Summary:

This is a brand new Mixture of Export (MoE) model from DeepSeek, specializing in coding instructions.<br>
This model performs well across a series of coding benchmarks and should be used for both instruction following and code completion.

## Prompt template:

The best performing template is `Deepseek Coder` preset in your LM Studio.

This will format the prompt as follows:

```
You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.",
### Instruction: {user_message}
### Response: {assistant_message}
```

The "official" template seems to tend towards generating Chinese, however if you'd like to use it you can set it up by choosing the `LM Studio Blank Preset` preset in your LM Studio and then:

Set your User Message Prefix to `User: `

Set your User Message Suffix to `\n\nAssistant: `

This will format the prompt as follows:

```
User: {user_message}

Assistant: {assistant_message}
```

## Technical Details

This model is an MoE architecture, using 16B total weights with only 2.4B activated to achieve excellent inference speed.

DeepSeek-Coder-V2 is based on the DeepSeek-V2 model, further trained on 6 trillion high quality coding tokens to enhance coding and mathematical reasoning. 

It supports an incredible 128k context length.
