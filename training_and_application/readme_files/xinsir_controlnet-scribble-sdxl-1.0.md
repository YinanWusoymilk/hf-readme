<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

Hello, I am very happy to announce the controlnet-scribble-sdxl-1.0 model, **a very powerful controlnet that can generate high resolution images visually comparable with midjourney**. 
The model was trained with large amount of high quality data(over 10000000 images), with carefully filtered and captioned(powerful vllm model). Besides, useful tricks are applied 
during the training, including date augmentation, mutiple loss and multi resolution. Note that this model can achieve higher aesthetic performance than our Controlnet-Canny-Sdxl-1.0 model,
the model support any type of lines and any width of lines, the sketch can be very simple and so does the prompt. This model is more general and good at generate visual appealing images,
The control ability is also strong, for example if you are unstatisfied with some local regions about the generated image, draw a more precise sketch and give a detail prompt will help a lot. 
**Note the model also support lineart or canny lines, you can try it and will get a surpurise!!!**

## Evaluation Data
The test data is randomly sample from midjourney upscale images with prompts, as the purpose of the project is to letting people draw images like midjourney. midjourneyâ€™s users include a large number of professional designers,
and the upscale image tend to have more beauty score and prompt consistency, it is suitable to use it as the test set to judge the ability of controlnet. We select 300 prompt-image pairs randomly and generate 4 images per prompt,
totally 1200 images generated. We caculate the Laion Aesthetic Score to measure the beauty and the PerceptualSimilarity to measure the control ability, we find the quality of images have a good consistency with the meric values.
We compare our methods with other SOTA huggingface models and list the result below. We are the models that have highest aesthectic score, and can generate visually appealing images if you prompt it properly.

Note: The condition image are generated using HED detector and random threshold to generate different kinds of lines.

## Quantitative Result
| metric | xinsir/controlnet-scribble-sdxl-1.0 | 
|-------|-------|
| laion_aesthetic |  **6.03**   |
| perceptual similarity | 0.5701 |

laion_aesthetic(the higher the better)  
perceptual similarity(the lower the better)

Note: The values are caculated when save in webp format, when save in png the aesthetic values will increase 0.1-0.3, but the relative relation remains unchanged.

### Conclusion

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->
In our evaluation, the model can generate visually appealing images using simple sketch and simple prompt. This model can support any type of lines and any width of lines, using thick line will give a coarse control
which obey the prompt your write more, and using thick line will give a strong control which obey the condition image more. The model can help you complish the drawing from coarse to fine, the model achieves higher 
aesthetic score than xinsir/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0, but the control ability will decrease a bit because of thick line.
