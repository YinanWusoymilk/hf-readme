gemini nano extracted from chrome

loadable through [mediapipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe), ~~but it's a base model so it won't be very coherent~~. maybe try applying the [adapter](https://huggingface.co/wave-on-discord/gemini-nano-adapter)?

update: looks like this one has some instruction tuning. idk what the adapter is for then
