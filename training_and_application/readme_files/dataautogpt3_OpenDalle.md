# OpenDalle

I'm thrilled to share an update on a recent project of mine. After some dedicated work, I've developed a highly effective text-to-image model. This innovation results from integrating the DPO model from Hugging Face with several advanced counterparts, including Juggernaut7XL, ALBEDOXL, MEARGEHEAVEN, and a model of my own design. The outcome is a unique fusion that showcases exceptional prompt adherence and semantic understanding, it seems to be a step above base SDXL and a step closer to DALLE-3 in terms of prompt comprehension. Notably, this model excels in interpreting and adhering to the given prompts, focusing more on semantic accuracy than on ultra-high-fidelity image generation.

## Settings for OpenDalle v1.0

Use these settings for the best results with OpenDalle v1.0:

CFG Scale: Use a CFG scale of 8 to 7

Steps: 60 to 70 steps for more detail, 35 steps for faster results.

Sampler: DPM2

Scheduler: Normal or Karras
