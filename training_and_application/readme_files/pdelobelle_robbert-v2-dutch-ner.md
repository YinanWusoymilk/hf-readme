# RobBERT: Dutch RoBERTa-based Language Model.

[RobBERT](https://github.com/iPieter/RobBERT) is the state-of-the-art Dutch BERT model. It is a large pre-trained general Dutch language model that can be fine-tuned on a given dataset to perform any text classification, regression or token-tagging task. As such, it has been successfully used by many [researchers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=7180110604335112086) and [practitioners](https://huggingface.co/models?search=robbert) for achieving state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of Dutch natural language processing tasks,
