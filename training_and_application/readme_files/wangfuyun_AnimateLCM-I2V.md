# AnimateLCM-I2V for Fast Image-conditioned Video Generation in 4 steps.

AnimateLCM-I2V is a latent image-to-video consistency model finetuned with [AnimateLCM](https://huggingface.co/wangfuyun/AnimateLCM) following the strategy proposed in [AnimateLCM-paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00769) without requiring teacher models.
