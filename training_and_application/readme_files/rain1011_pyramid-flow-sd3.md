# ‚ö°Ô∏èPyramid Flow‚ö°Ô∏è

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954) [[Project Page ‚ú®]](https://pyramid-flow.github.io) [[Code üöÄ]](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow) [[demo ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pyramid-Flow/pyramid-flow)]

This is the official repository for Pyramid Flow, a training-efficient **Autoregressive Video Generation** method based on **Flow Matching**. By training only on open-source datasets, it generates high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS, and naturally supports image-to-video generation.

## News

* `COMING SOON` ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è Training code and new model checkpoints trained from scratch.
* `2024.10.11`  ü§óü§óü§ó [Hugging Face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pyramid-Flow/pyramid-flow) is available. Thanks [@multimodalart](https://huggingface.co/multimodalart) for the commit! 
* `2024.10.10`  üöÄüöÄüöÄ We release the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954), [project page](https://pyramid-flow.github.io) and [model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3) of Pyramid Flow.

## Installation

We recommend setting up the environment with conda. The codebase currently uses Python 3.8.10 and PyTorch 2.1.2, and we are actively working to support a wider range of versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow
cd Pyramid-Flow

# create env using conda
conda create -n pyramid python==3.8.10
conda activate pyramid
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can directly download the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3). We provide both model checkpoints for 768p and 384p video generation. The 384p checkpoint supports 5-second video generation at 24FPS, while the 768p checkpoint supports up to 10-second video generation at 24FPS.

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

model_path = 'PATH'   # The local directory to save downloaded checkpoint
snapshot_download("rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, repo_type='model')
```

## Usage

To use our model, please follow the inference code in `video_generation_demo.ipynb` at [this link](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/blob/main/video_generation_demo.ipynb). We further simplify it into the following two-step procedure. First, load the downloaded model:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from pyramid_dit import PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration
from diffusers.utils import load_image, export_to_video

torch.cuda.set_device(0)
model_dtype, torch_dtype = 'bf16', torch.bfloat16   # Use bf16 (not support fp16 yet)

model = PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration(
    'PATH',                                         # The downloaded checkpoint dir
    model_dtype,
    model_variant='diffusion_transformer_768p',     # 'diffusion_transformer_384p'
)

model.vae.to("cuda")
model.dit.to("cuda")
model.text_encoder.to("cuda")
model.vae.enable_tiling()
```

Then, you can try text-to-video generation on your own prompts:

```python
prompt = "A movie trailer featuring the adventures of the 30 year old space man wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style, shot on 35mm film, vivid colors"

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate(
        prompt=prompt,
        num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20],
        video_num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        height=768,     
        width=1280,
        temp=16,                    # temp=16: 5s, temp=31: 10s
        guidance_scale=9.0,         # The guidance for the first frame, set it to 7 for 384p variant
        video_guidance_scale=5.0,   # The guidance for the other video latent
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./text_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

As an autoregressive model, our model also supports (text conditioned) image-to-video generation:

```python
image = Image.open('assets/the_great_wall.jpg').convert("RGB").resize((1280, 768))
prompt = "FPV flying over the Great Wall"

with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    frames = model.generate_i2v(
        prompt=prompt,
        input_image=image,
        num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],
        temp=16,
        video_guidance_scale=4.0,
        output_type="pil",
        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed
    )

export_to_video(frames, "./image_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)
```

We also support CPU offloading to allow inference with **less than 12GB** of GPU memory by adding a `cpu_offloading=True` parameter. This feature was contributed by [@Ednaordinary](https://github.com/Ednaordinary), see [#23](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow/pull/23) for details.

## Usage tips

* The `guidance_scale` parameter controls the visual quality. We suggest using a guidance within [7, 9] for the 768p checkpoint during text-to-video generation, and 7 for the 384p checkpoint.
* The `video_guidance_scale` parameter controls the motion. A larger value increases the dynamic degree and mitigates the autoregressive generation degradation, while a smaller value stabilizes the video.
* For 10-second video generation, we recommend using a guidance scale of 7 and a video guidance scale of 5.
