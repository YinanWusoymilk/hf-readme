Ramble to meet minimum length requirements:

Tbh i wonder if this shit is even worth doing. Like im just some broke guy lmao I've spent so much. And for what? I guess creds. Feels good when a model gets good feedback, but it seems like im invisible sometimes. I should be probably advertising myself and my models on other places but I rarely have the time to. Probably just internal jealousy sparking up here and now. Wahtever I guess.

Anyway cool EMT vocation I'm doing is cool except it pays peanuts, damn bruh 1.1k per month lmao. Government to broke to pay for shit. Pays the bills I suppose.

Anyway cool beans, I'm either going to continue the Solar Train or go to Mixtral / Yi when I get paid.

You still here?
