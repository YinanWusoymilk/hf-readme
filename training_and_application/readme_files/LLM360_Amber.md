<center><img src="amber_logo.png" alt="amber logo" width="150"/></center>

Amber is an7B English language model with the LLaMA architecture. Amber is part of LLM360's Pebble model series.

360 model checkpoints and the full data sequence are available under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Evaluations
| Metric      | Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ARC-C      | 42.57       |

- 360 checkpoints are available for download
- To downloading other checkpoints, change the branch from 'main' to the checkpoint you want (e.g. 'ckpt_000'). 
- This is completed on the 'Files and versions' tab (to the right of the Model Card).

## ðŸŸ  Loading Amber 

To load a specific checkpoint, simply pass a revision with a value between `"ckpt_000"` and `"ckpt_358"`. If no revision is provided, it will load `"ckpt_359"`, which is the final checkpoint.

```python
from transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("LLM360/Amber", revision="ckpt_356")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("LLM360/Amber", revision="ckpt_356")

input_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

outputs = model.generate(input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))

```

## About LLM360
LLM360 is an initiative for comprehensive and fully open-sourced LLMs, 
where all training details, model checkpoints, intermediate results, and 
additional analyses are made available to the community. Our goal is to advance 
the field by inviting the community to deepen the understanding of LLMs 
together. As the first step of the project LLM360, we release all intermediate 
model checkpoints, our fully-prepared pre-training dataset, all source code and
configurations, and training details. We are
committed to continually pushing the boundaries of LLMs through this open-source 
effort.
