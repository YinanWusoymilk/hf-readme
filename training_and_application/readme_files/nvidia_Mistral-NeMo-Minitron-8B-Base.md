# Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-Base

## Model Overview

Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-Base is a base text-to-text model that can be adopted for a variety of natural language generation tasks. It is a large language model (LLM) obtained by pruning and distilling the Mistral-NeMo 12B; specifically, we prune the embedding dimension and MLP intermediate dimension in the  model. Following pruning, we perform continued training with distillation using 380 billion tokens to arrive at the final model; we use the continuous pre-training data corpus used in Nemotron-4 15B for this purpose. Please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11796) for more details.

**Model Developer:** NVIDIA

**Model Dates:** Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-Base was trained between July 24, 2024 and August 10, 2024.

## Usage
Support for this model will be added in the upcoming `transformers` release. In the meantime, please install the library from source:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```
We can now run inference on this model:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_path = "nvidia/Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-Base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

device = 'cuda'
dtype = torch.bfloat16
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=dtype, device_map=device)

# Prepare the input text
prompt = 'Complete the paragraph: our solar system is'
inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)

# Generate the output
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=20)

# Decode and print the output
output_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(output_text)
```

## Inference

**Engine:** TensorRT-LLM 

**Test Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 

**DType:** BFloat16

## Limitations

The model was trained on data that contains toxic language, unsafe content, and societal biases originally crawled from the internet. Therefore, the model may amplify those biases and return toxic responses especially when prompted with toxic prompts. The model may generate answers that may be inaccurate, omit key information, or include irrelevant or redundant text producing socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive. 

## Ethical Considerations

NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications. When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their internal model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant industry and use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.
