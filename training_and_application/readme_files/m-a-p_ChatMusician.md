## Introduction

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in text generation,
we find that their ability has yet to be generalized to music, humanity‚Äôs creative language.
We introduce **ChatMusician**, **an open-source LLM that integrates intrinsic musical abilities**.

It is based on continual pre-training and finetuning LLaMA2 on a text-compatible music representation, ABC notation, and the music is treated as a second language. ChatMusician can understand and generate music with a pure text tokenizer without any external multi-modal neural structures or tokenizers. Interestingly, endowing musical abilities does not harm language abilities, even achieving a slightly higher MMLU score. Our model is capable of composing well-structured, full-length music, conditioned on texts, chords, melodies, motifs, musical forms, etc, surpassing GPT-4 baseline. On our meticulously curated college-level music understanding benchmark, MusicTheoryBench, ChatMusician surpasses LLaMA2 and GPT-3.5 on zero-shot setting by a noticeable
margin. Our work reveals that LLMs can be an excellent compressor for music, but there remains significant territory to be conquered. Code, data, model, and benchmark are open-sourced.

## Usage

You can use the models through Huggingface's Transformers library. Check our Github repo for more advanced use: [https://github.com/hf-lin/ChatMusician](https://github.com/hf-lin/ChatMusician) -->

## CLI demo
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, GenerationConfig
import torch
import torchaudio
import re
from string import Template
prompt_template = Template("Human: ${inst} </s> Assistant: ")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("m-a-p/ChatMusician", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("m-a-p/ChatMusician", torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="cuda", resume_download=True).eval()

generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.2,
    top_k=40,
    top_p=0.9,
    do_sample=True,
    num_beams=1,
    repetition_penalty=1.1,
    min_new_tokens=10,
    max_new_tokens=1536
)

instruction = """Develop a musical piece using the given chord progression.
'Dm', 'C', 'Dm', 'Dm', 'C', 'Dm', 'C', 'Dm'
"""

prompt = prompt_template.safe_substitute({"inst": instruction})
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", add_special_tokens=False)
response = model.generate(
        input_ids=inputs["input_ids"].to(model.device),
        attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'].to(model.device),
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        generation_config=generation_config,
        )
response = tokenizer.decode(response[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)

# to render abc notation, you need to install symusic
# pip install symusic
from symusic import Score, Synthesizer, BuiltInSF3, dump_wav

abc_pattern = r'(X:\d+\n(?:[^\n]*\n)+)'
abc_notation = re.findall(abc_pattern, response+'\n')[0]
s = Score.from_abc(abc_notation)
audio = Synthesizer().render(s, stereo=True)
torchaudio.save('cm_music_piece.wav', torch.FloatTensor(audio), 44100)
```

## Chat demo
ChatMusician supports gradio web demo and multi-turn dialogue, please visit our [github](https://github.com/hf-lin/ChatMusician) for more details.
Our web demo also supports rendering ABC scores into images.

## Limitations
- The model currently only supports strict format and close-ended instructions for the music tasks. If we have more funding, we plan to create a more diverse multi-turn music instruction chat data for better generalization.
- The model suffers from hallucinations, and shouldn't be used for music education. It could be improved by feeding more music textbooks, blogs, etc. And RLHF may help, too.
- A large portion of the training data is in the style of Irish music. If possible, the community should develop a converter between performance midi and ABC scores, so that we can include more established midi datasets.
- The MusicThoeryBench results reported in the paper are obtained with perplexity mode. Direct generation may result in a worse performance.
- We observe that using the current version of training data, ChatMusician presents a weak in-context-learning and chain-of-thoughts ability. The community should work on improving the music data quality.

## Training Data

ChatMusician is pretrained on the ü§ó [MusicPile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/MusicPile), which is the first pretraining corpus for **developing musical abilities** in large language models. Check out the dataset card for more details.
And supervised finetuned on 1.1M samples(2:1 ratio between music scores
and music knowledge & music summary data) from MusicPile. Check our [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16153) for more details.


## Evaluation

1. Music understanding abilities are evaluated on the [MusicTheoryBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/MusicTheoryBench). The following figure is zero-shot accuracy on MusicTheoryBench.
We included GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMA2-7B-Base, ChatMusician-Base, and ChatMusician. The blue bar represents the performance on the music knowledge metric, and the red bar represents the music reasoning metric. The dashed line corresponds to a random baseline, with a score of 25%.
