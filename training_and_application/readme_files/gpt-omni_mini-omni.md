</p>

Mini-Omni is an open-source multimodel large language model that can **hear, talk while thinking**. Featuring real-time end-to-end speech input and **streaming audio output** conversational capabilities.

## Features

âœ… **Real-time speech-to-speech** conversational capabilities. No extra ASR or TTS models required.

âœ… **Talking while thinking**, with the ability to generate text and audio at the same time.

âœ… **Streaming audio outupt** capabilities.

âœ… With "Audio-to-Text" and "Audio-to-Audio" **batch inference** to further boost the performance.

**NOTE**: please refer to the [code repository](https://github.com/gpt-omni/mini-omni) for more details.

## Install

Create a new conda environment and install the required packages:

```sh
conda create -n omni python=3.10
conda activate omni

git clone https://github.com/gpt-omni/mini-omni.git
cd mini-omni
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start

**Interactive demo**

- start server
```sh
conda activate omni
cd mini-omni
python3 server.py --ip '0.0.0.0' --port 60808
```

- run streamlit demo

NOTE: you need to run streamlit locally with PyAudio installed.

```sh
pip install PyAudio==0.2.14
API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:60808/chat streamlit run webui/omni_streamlit.py
```

- run gradio demo
```sh
API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:60808/chat python3 webui/omni_gradio.py
```

example:

NOTE: need to unmute first. Gradio seems can not play audio stream instantly, so the latency feels a bit longer.

**Local test**

```sh
conda activate omni
cd mini-omni
# test run the preset audio samples and questions
python inference.py
```
