**Model creator:** [meta-llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama)<br>
**Original model**: [Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)<br>
**GGUF quantization:** provided by [bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) based on `llama.cpp` release [b3472](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b3441)<br>

<span style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>Important:</b> Requires LM Studio version 0.2.29, available now [here](https://lmstudio.ai/)!</span>

## Model Summary:

Llama 3.1 is an update to the previously released family of Llama 3 models. It has improved performance across the board, especially in multilingual tasks.<br>
It is the current state of the art for open source and can be used for basically any task you throw at it.

## Prompt Template:

Choose the 'Llama 3' preset in your LM Studio. 

Under the hood, the model will see a prompt that's formatted like so:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

{system_prompt}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

{prompt}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

```

## Technical Details

Llama 3.1 features an improved 128k context window.

It has been trained on 15T tokens, including 25 million synthetically generated samples.
