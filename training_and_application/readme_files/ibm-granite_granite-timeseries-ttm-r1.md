TinyTimeMixers (TTMs) are compact pre-trained models for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting, open-sourced by IBM Research. 
**With less than 1 Million parameters, TTM (accepted in NeurIPS 24) introduces the notion of the first-ever “tiny” pre-trained models for Time-Series Forecasting.** 


TTM outperforms several popular benchmarks demanding billions of parameters in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting. TTMs are lightweight 
forecasters, pre-trained on publicly available time series data with various augmentations. TTM provides state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasts and can easily be 
fine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts with just 5% of the training data to be competitive.  Refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf) for more details.


**The current open-source version supports point forecasting use-cases specifically ranging from minutely to hourly resolutions 
(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.).**

**Note that zeroshot, fine-tuning and inference tasks using TTM can easily be executed in 1 GPU machine or in laptops too!!**


TTM-R1 comprises TTM variants pre-trained on 250M public training samples. We have another set of TTM models released under TTM-R2 trained on a much larger pretraining
dataset (~700M samples) which can be accessed from [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2). In general, TTM-R2 models perform better than 
TTM-R1 models as they are trained on larger pretraining dataset. However, the choice of R1 vs R2 depends on your target data distribution. Hence requesting users to 
try both R1 and R2 variants and pick the best for your data.

## Model Releases (along with the branch name where the models are stored):


- **512-96:** Given the last 512 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)
  in future. This model is targeted towards a forecasting setting of context length 512 and forecast length 96 and
  recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). This model refers to the TTM-Q variant used in the paper. (branch name: main) [[Benchmark Scripts]](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/tinytimemixer/ttm_benchmarking_512_96.ipynb)

- **1024-96:** Given the last 1024 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)
  in future. This model is targeted towards a long forecasting setting of context length 1024 and forecast length 96 and
  recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). (branch name: 1024-96-v1) [[Benchmark Scripts]](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/tinytimemixer/ttm_benchmarking_1024_96.ipynb)

## Benchmarks

TTM outperforms popular benchmarks such as TimesFM, Moirai, Chronos, Lag-Llama, Moment, GPT4TS, TimeLLM, LLMTime in zero/fewshot forecasting while reducing computational requirements significantly. 
Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider
adoption in resource-constrained environments. For more details, refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf) TTM-Q referred in the paper maps to the `512-96` model
uploaded in the main branch. Please refer to our paper for more details.

## Recommended Use
1. Users have to externally standard scale their data independently for every channel before feeding it to the model (Refer to [TSP](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/tsfm_public/toolkit/time_series_preprocessor.py), our data processing utility for data scaling.)
2. The current open-source version supports only minutely and hourly resolutions(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). Other lower resolutions (say weekly, or monthly) are currently not supported in this version, as the model needs a minimum context length of 512 or 1024.
3. Enabling any upsampling or prepending zeros to virtually increase the context length for shorter-length datasets is not recommended and will
   impact the model performance. 


## Model Description

TTM falls under the category of “focused pre-trained models”, wherein each pre-trained TTM is tailored for a particular forecasting 
setting (governed by the context length and forecast length). Instead of building one massive model supporting all forecasting settings, 
we opt for the approach of constructing smaller pre-trained models, each focusing on a specific forecasting setting, thereby 
yielding more accurate results. Furthermore, this approach ensures that our models remain extremely small and exceptionally fast, 
facilitating easy deployment without demanding a ton of resources. 

Hence, in this model card, we plan to release several pre-trained 
TTMs that can cater to many common forecasting settings in practice. Additionally, we have released our source code along with 
our pretraining scripts that users can utilize to pretrain models on their own. Pretraining TTMs is very easy and fast, taking 
only 3-6 hours using 6 A100 GPUs, as opposed to several days or weeks in traditional approaches.

Each pre-trained model will be released in a different branch name in this model card. Kindly access the required model using our 
getting started [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/ttm_getting_started.ipynb) mentioning the branch name.


## Model Details

For more details on TTM architecture and benchmarks, refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).

TTM-1 currently supports 2 modes:

 - **Zeroshot forecasting**: Directly apply the pre-trained model on your target data to get an initial forecast (with no training).

 - **Finetuned forecasting**: Finetune the pre-trained model with a subset of your target data to further improve the forecast.

**Since, TTM models are extremely small and fast, it is practically very easy to finetune the model with your available target data in few minutes 
to get more accurate forecasts.**

The current release supports multivariate forecasting via both channel independence and channel-mixing approaches. 
Decoder Channel-Mixing can be enabled during fine-tuning for capturing strong channel-correlation patterns across 
time-series variates, a critical capability lacking in existing counterparts.

In addition, TTM also supports exogenous infusion and categorical data infusion.
