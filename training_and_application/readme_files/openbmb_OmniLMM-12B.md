## OmniLMM 12B

[GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V) | [Demo](http://120.92.209.146:8081/)

**OmniLMM-12B** is the most capable version of OmniLMM currently. The model is built based on EVA02-5B and Zephyr-7B-Œ≤, connected with a perceiver resampler layer, and trained on multimodal data in a curriculum fashion. The model has three notable features:

- üî• **Strong Performance.** 

  OmniLMM-12B achieves **leading performance** among models with comparable sizes, surpassing established LMMs on multiple benchmarks (including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, etc). The model also endows rich multi-modal world knowledge.

- üèÜ **Trustworthy Behavior.** 

  LMMs are known for suffering from hallucination, often generating text that is not factually grounded in images (e.g., faithfully describing non-existing objects in images). OmniLMM-12B is **the first state-of-the-art open-source LMM aligned via multimodal RLHF for trustworthy behavior** (using the recent [RLHF-V](https://rlhf-v.github.io/) technique). It **ranks #1** among open-source models on [MMHal-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shengcao1006/MMHal-Bench), and **outperforms GPT-4V** on [Object HalBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00849).

- üïπ **Real-time Multimodal Interaction.** 

  We combine the OmniLMM-12B and GPT-3.5 (text-only) into a **real-time multimodal interactive assistant**. The assistant accepts video streams from the camera and speech streams from the microphone and emits speech output. While still primary, we find the model can **replicate some of the fun cases shown in the Gemini Demo video, without any video edition**.
