# FLUX.1-dev-LoRA-AntiBlur

This is a functional LoRA trained on FLUX.1-dev for deep DoF (Anti-BlurðŸ”¥) by [Vadim_Fedenko](https://www.shakker.ai/userpage/1f90018d803d4045b8dec4d627915098/publish) on [Shakker AI](https://www.shakker.ai/modelinfo/5c3fa3f1d5034e63be325196eae0b4f6?from=search). 
It may not be fancy, but it works.

## Comparison

The following example shows a simple comparison with FLUX.1-dev under the same parameter setting.

</div>

It is worth noting that this LoRA has very little damage to image quality while enhancing the depth of field, and can be used together with other components, such as ControlNet. We regard it as a basic functional LoRA.

## Trigger words
The trigger word is not required. The recommended scale is `1.0` to `1.5` in diffusers.

## Inference

```python
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline

pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.load_lora_weights("Shakker-Labs/FLUX.1-dev-LoRA-AntiBlur", weight_name="FLUX-dev-lora-AntiBlur.safetensors")
pipe.fuse_lora(lora_scale=1.5)
pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a young college student, walking on the street, campus background, photography"

image = pipe(prompt, 
             num_inference_steps=24, 
             guidance_scale=3.5,
             width=768, height=1024,
            ).images[0]
image.save(f"example.png")
```
