If you are looking for models, go to the "files and versions" section, however, the files listed there do not have any order in huggingface, for some time now they have been uploaded with a random id to avoid duplicates.

Below you will find an updated list with unrepeated models and their respective names + link.

Additionally, you can use the huggingface space to make inferences directly from this page, just provide the model link and upload your audio.
