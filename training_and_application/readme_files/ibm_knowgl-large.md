# KnowGL: Knowledge Generation and Linking from Text

The `knowgl-large` model is trained by combining Wikidata with an extended version of the training data in the [REBEL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Babelscape/rebel-dataset) dataset. Given a sentence, KnowGL generates triple(s) in the following format:
```
[(subject mention # subject label # subject type) | relation label | (object mention # object label # object type)]
```
If there are more than one triples generated, they are separated by `$` in the output. More details in [Rossiello et al. (AAAI 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13952.pdf).

The model achieves state-of-the-art results for relation extraction on the REBEL dataset. See results in [Mihindukulasooriya et al. (ISWC 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05188.pdf).

The generated labels (for the subject, relation, and object) and their types can be directly mapped to Wikidata IDs associated with them.
