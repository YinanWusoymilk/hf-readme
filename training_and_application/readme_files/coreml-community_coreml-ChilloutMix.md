# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to [Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion). Conversion instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-or-safetensors-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as Mochi Diffusion [Github](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) - [Discord](https://discord.gg/x2kartzxGv) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
  - `original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.<br>
  - Custom resolution versions are tagged accordingly.<br>
  - `vae` tagged files have a vae embedded into the model.<br>
  - Descriptions are posted as-is from original model source. Not all features and/or results may be available in CoreML format.<br>
  - This model was converted with `vae-encoder` for i2i.

# Note: Some models do not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

Use vae-ft-mse-840000

I think this model is Good for realistic Asian girls's nsfw pose. (...........now, You chill out.)

I prefer to use "Ulzzang-6500" embeddings (all samples)
