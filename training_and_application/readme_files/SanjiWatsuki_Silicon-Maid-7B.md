## WTF is This?

Silicon-Maid-7B is another model targeted at being both strong at RP **and** being a smart cookie that can follow character cards very well. As of right now, Silicon-Maid-7B outscores both of my previous 7B RP models in my RP benchmark and I have been impressed by this model's creativity. It is suitable for RP/ERP and general use. Quants can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/SanjiWatsuki/silicon-maid-7b-658d1669292816fe4992daa4).

It's built on [xDAN-AI/xDAN-L1-Chat-RL-v1](https://huggingface.co/xDAN-AI/xDAN-L1-Chat-RL-v1), a 7B model which scores unusually high on MT-Bench, and chargoddard/loyal-piano-m7, an Alpaca format 7B model with surprisingly creative outputs. I was excited to see this model for two main reasons:
* MT-Bench normally correlates well with real world model quality
* It was an Alpaca prompt model with high benches which meant I could try swapping out my Marcoroni frankenmerge used in my previous model.

^1 xDAN's testing placed it 8.35 - this number is from my independent MT-Bench run.

It's unclear to me if xDAN-L1-Chat-RL-v1 is overtly benchmaxxing but it seemed like a solid 7B from my limited testing (although nothing that screams 2nd best model behind GPT-4). Amusingly, the model lost a lot of Reasoning and Coding skills in the merger. This was a much greater MT-Bench dropoff than I expected, perhaps suggesting the Math/Reasoning ability in the original model was rather dense and susceptible to being lost to a DARE TIE merger?

Besides that, the merger is almost identical to the Loyal-Macaroni-Maid merger with a new base "smart cookie" model. If you liked any of my previous RP models, give this one a shot and let me know in the Community tab what you think!

### Prompt Template (Alpaca)
I found the best SillyTavern results from using the Noromaid template but please try other templates! Let me know if you find anything good.

SillyTavern config files: [Context](https://files.catbox.moe/ifmhai.json), [Instruct](https://files.catbox.moe/ttw1l9.json).

Additionally, here is my highly recommended [Text Completion preset](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Loyal-Macaroni-Maid-7B/blob/main/Characters/MinP.json). You can tweak this by adjusting temperature up or dropping min p to boost creativity or raise min p to increase stability. You shouldn't need to touch anything else!
