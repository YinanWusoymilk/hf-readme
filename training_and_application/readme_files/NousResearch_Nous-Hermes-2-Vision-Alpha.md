*In the tapestry of Greek mythology, Hermes reigns as the eloquent Messenger of the Gods, a deity who deftly bridges the realms through the art of communication. It is in homage to this divine mediator that I name this advanced LLM "Hermes," a system crafted to navigate the complex intricacies of human discourse with celestial finesse.*

## Model description

Nous-Hermes-2-Vision stands as a pioneering Vision-Language Model, leveraging advancements from the renowned **OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B** by teknium. This model incorporates two pivotal enhancements, setting it apart as a cutting-edge solution:

- **SigLIP-400M Integration**: Diverging from traditional approaches that rely on substantial 3B vision encoders, Nous-Hermes-2-Vision harnesses the formidable SigLIP-400M. This strategic choice not only streamlines the model's architecture, making it more lightweight, but also capitalizes on SigLIP's remarkable capabilities. The result? A remarkable boost in performance that defies conventional expectations.

- **Custom Dataset Enriched with Function Calling**: Our model's training data includes a unique feature â€“ function calling. This distinctive addition transforms Nous-Hermes-2-Vision into a **Vision-Language Action Model**. Developers now have a versatile tool at their disposal, primed for crafting a myriad of ingenious automations.

This project is led by [qnguyen3](https://twitter.com/stablequan) and [teknium](https://twitter.com/Teknium1).
## Training
### Dataset
- 220K from **LVIS-INSTRUCT4V**
- 60K from **ShareGPT4V**
- 150K Private **Function Calling Data**
- 50K conversations from teknium's **OpenHermes-2.5**

## Usage
### Prompt Format
- Like other LLaVA's variants, this model uses Vicuna-V1 as its prompt template. Please refer to `conv_llava_v1` in [this file](https://github.com/qnguyen3/hermes-llava/blob/main/llava/conversation.py)
- For Gradio UI, please visit this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/qnguyen3/hermes-llava)

### Function Calling
- For functiong calling, the message should start with a `<fn_call>` tag. Here is an example:

```json
<fn_call>{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "bus_colors": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "The colors of the bus in the image.",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["red", "blue", "green", "white"]
      }
    },
    "bus_features": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The features seen on the back of the bus."
    },
    "bus_location": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The location of the bus (driving or pulled off to the side).",
      "enum": ["driving", "pulled off to the side"]
    }
  }
}
```

Output:
```json
{
  "bus_colors": ["red", "white"],
  "bus_features": "An advertisement",
  "bus_location": "driving"
}
```

        "items": {
          "type": "string",
        }
      },
    }
}
```

Output:
```json
{
    "food_list": [
        "Double Burger",
        "Cheeseburger",
        "French Fries",
