### herge_style on Stable Diffusion via Dreambooth
#### model by maderix
This your the Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned the herge_style concept taught to Stable Diffusion with Dreambooth.
It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of sks herge_style**

You can also train your own concepts and upload them to the library by using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_training.ipynb).
And you can run your new concept via `diffusers`: [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb), [Spaces with the Public Concepts loaded](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sd-dreambooth-library/stable-diffusion-dreambooth-concepts)

Here are the images used for training this concept:
