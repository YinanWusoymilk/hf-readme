# 🚀 FocalNet NSFW Image Classifier: Your Content Moderation Superhero! 🦸‍♂️

## 🌟 Discover the Power of Intelligent Moderation!

👋 Are you ready for a revolution in content moderation? Meet the FocalNet NSFW Image Classifier - your new, lightning-fast, and super-smart assistant in the battle against inappropriate content!

## 🎭 Who Am I?

I'm an advanced AI model, built on the powerful `microsoft/focalnet-base`. My superpower is the lightning-fast classification of images into three categories:

- 🟢 SAFE: "Green light! Let's roll with this content!"
- 🟡 QUESTIONABLE: "Hmm... Maybe we should take a second look?"
- 🔴 UNSAFE: "Whoa! Let's stop this before anyone sees it!"

## 🦾 What Can I Do?

Imagine you're the guardian of the internet galaxy. Your mission? Protect users from shocking, inappropriate content. But how do you review millions of images daily? That's where I come in!

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Lightning-Fast Detection:** I'll analyze every pixel faster than you can say "safe content"!
- 🛡️ **Protective Shield:** I'll stand guard over your platforms, shielding users from unwanted content.
- 🎯 **Sniper's Precision:** My eye is so sharp that I can spot potential threats with surgical accuracy.

## 🚀 How to Use Me?

Ready for an adventure? Here's how you can harness my power:

1. **Install my powers:**
   ```
   pip install transformers==4.37.2 torch==2.3.1 torchvision Pillow
   ```

2. **Summon me in your code:**
   ```python
   import os
   from PIL import Image
   import torch
   from torchvision import transforms
   from transformers import AutoProcessor, FocalNetForImageClassification
   
   # Path to the folder with images
   image_folder = ""
   # Path to the model
   model_path = "MichalMlodawski/nsfw-image-detection-large" 
   
   # List of jpg files in the folder
   jpg_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder) if file.lower().endswith(".jpg")]
   
   # Check if there are jpg files in the folder
   if not jpg_files:
       print("🚫 No jpg files found in folder:", image_folder)
       exit()
   
   # Load the model and feature extractor
   feature_extractor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path)
   model = FocalNetForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
   model.eval()
   
   # Image transformations
   transform = transforms.Compose([
       transforms.Resize((512, 512)),
       transforms.ToTensor(),
       transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
   ])
   
   # Mapping from model labels to NSFW categories
   label_to_category = {
       "LABEL_0": "Safe",
       "LABEL_1": "Questionable",
       "LABEL_2": "Unsafe"
   }
   
   # Processing and prediction for each image
   results = []
   for jpg_file in jpg_files:
       selected_image = os.path.join(image_folder, jpg_file)
       image = Image.open(selected_image).convert("RGB")
       image_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
       
       # Process image using feature_extractor
       inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
       
       # Prediction using the model
       with torch.no_grad():
           outputs = model(**inputs)
           probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
           confidence, predicted = torch.max(probabilities, 1)
       
       # Get the label from the model's configuration
       label = model.config.id2label[predicted.item()]
       
       results.append((jpg_file, label, confidence.item() * 100))
   
   # Display results
   print("🖼️  NSFW Classification Results 🖼️")
   print("=" * 40)
   for jpg_file, label, confidence in results:
       category = label_to_category.get(label, "Unknown")
       emoji = {"Safe": "✅", "Questionable": "⚠️", "Unsafe": "🔞"}.get(category, "❓")
       confidence_bar = "🟩" * int(confidence // 10) + "⬜" * (10 - int(confidence // 10))
       
       print(f"📄 File name: {jpg_file}")
       print(f"🏷️ Model Label: {label}")
       print(f"{emoji} NSFW Category: {category}")
       print(f"🎯 Confidence: {confidence:.2f}% {confidence_bar}")
       print(f"{'=' * 40}")
   
   print("🏁 Classification completed! 🎉")
   ```
