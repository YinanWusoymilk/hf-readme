# Model Card for ioclab/ioc-controlnet

This model brings brightness control to Stable Diffusion, allowing users to colorize grayscale images or recolor generated images.

## Model Details

- **Developed by:** [@shichen](https://github.com/chenbaiyujason)
- **Shared by [optional]:** [More Information Needed]
- **Model type:** Stable Diffusion ControlNet model for [web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
- **License:** [The CreativeML OpenRAIL M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) is an [Open RAIL M license](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses), adapted from the work that [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) and [the RAIL Initiative](https://www.licenses.ai/) are jointly carrying in the area of responsible AI licensing. See also [the article about the BLOOM Open RAIL license](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license) on which our license is based.


## Uses

Recommendation Weight: **0.4-0.9**

Recommendation Exit Timing: **0.4-0.9**

As more datasets are still being trained in this model, it is expected to take 2-4 days. Therefore, flexible weight adjustments should be made based on different scenarios and specific results. If you have generated good images or encountered any problems, you can discuss them on Hugging Face~~~
