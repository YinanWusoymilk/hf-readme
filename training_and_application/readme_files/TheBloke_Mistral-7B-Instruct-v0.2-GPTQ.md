## Provided files, and GPTQ parameters

Multiple quantisation parameters are provided, to allow you to choose the best one for your hardware and requirements.

Each separate quant is in a different branch.  See below for instructions on fetching from different branches.

Most GPTQ files are made with AutoGPTQ. Mistral models are currently made with Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Explanation of GPTQ parameters</summary>

- Bits: The bit size of the quantised model.
- GS: GPTQ group size. Higher numbers use less VRAM, but have lower quantisation accuracy. "None" is the lowest possible value.
- Act Order: True or False. Also known as `desc_act`. True results in better quantisation accuracy. Some GPTQ clients have had issues with models that use Act Order plus Group Size, but this is generally resolved now.
- Damp %: A GPTQ parameter that affects how samples are processed for quantisation. 0.01 is default, but 0.1 results in slightly better accuracy.
- GPTQ dataset: The calibration dataset used during quantisation. Using a dataset more appropriate to the model's training can improve quantisation accuracy. Note that the GPTQ calibration dataset is not the same as the dataset used to train the model - please refer to the original model repo for details of the training dataset(s).
- Sequence Length: The length of the dataset sequences used for quantisation. Ideally this is the same as the model sequence length. For some very long sequence models (16+K), a lower sequence length may have to be used. Note that a lower sequence length does not limit the sequence length of the quantised model. It only impacts the quantisation accuracy on longer inference sequences.
- ExLlama Compatibility: Whether this file can be loaded with ExLlama, which currently only supports Llama and Mistral models in 4-bit.

<!-- README_GPTQ.md-download-from-branches start -->
## How to download, including from branches

### In text-generation-webui

To download from the `main` branch, enter `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ` in the "Download model" box.

To download from another branch, add `:branchname` to the end of the download name, eg `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ:gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True`

### From the command line

I recommend using the `huggingface-hub` Python library:

```shell
pip3 install huggingface-hub
```

To download the `main` branch to a folder called `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ`:

```shell
mkdir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --local-dir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

To download from a different branch, add the `--revision` parameter:

```shell
mkdir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --revision gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True --local-dir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

<details>
  <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage</summary>

If you remove the `--local-dir-use-symlinks False` parameter, the files will instead be stored in the central Hugging Face cache directory (default location on Linux is: `~/.cache/huggingface`), and symlinks will be added to the specified `--local-dir`, pointing to their real location in the cache. This allows for interrupted downloads to be resumed, and allows you to quickly clone the repo to multiple places on disk without triggering a download again. The downside, and the reason why I don't list that as the default option, is that the files are then hidden away in a cache folder and it's harder to know where your disk space is being used, and to clear it up if/when you want to remove a download model.

The cache location can be changed with the `HF_HOME` environment variable, and/or the `--cache-dir` parameter to `huggingface-cli`.

For more documentation on downloading with `huggingface-cli`, please see: [HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download#download-from-the-cli).

To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install `hf_transfer`:

```shell
pip3 install hf_transfer
```

And set environment variable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` to `1`:

```shell
mkdir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --local-dir Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Windows Command Line users: You can set the environment variable by running `set HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` before the download command.
</details>

### With `git` (**not** recommended)

To clone a specific branch with `git`, use a command like this:

```shell
git clone --single-branch --branch gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ
```

Note that using Git with HF repos is strongly discouraged. It will be much slower than using `huggingface-hub`, and will use twice as much disk space as it has to store the model files twice (it stores every byte both in the intended target folder, and again in the `.git` folder as a blob.)

from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

endpoint_url = "https://your-endpoint-url-here"

prompt = "Tell me about AI"
prompt_template=f'''<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]
'''

client = InferenceClient(endpoint_url)
response = client.text_generation(prompt,
                                  max_new_tokens=128,
                                  do_sample=True,
                                  temperature=0.7,
                                  top_p=0.95,
                                  top_k=40,
                                  repetition_penalty=1.1)

print(f"Model output: {response}")
```

## Python code example: inference from this GPTQ model

### Install the necessary packages

Requires: Transformers 4.33.0 or later, Optimum 1.12.0 or later, and AutoGPTQ 0.4.2 or later.

```shell
pip3 install --upgrade transformers optimum
# If using PyTorch 2.1 + CUDA 12.x:
pip3 install --upgrade auto-gptq
# or, if using PyTorch 2.1 + CUDA 11.x:
pip3 install --upgrade auto-gptq --extra-index-url https://huggingface.github.io/autogptq-index/whl/cu118/
```

If you are using PyTorch 2.0, you will need to install AutoGPTQ from source. Likewise if you have problems with the pre-built wheels, you should try building from source:

```shell
pip3 uninstall -y auto-gptq
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ
cd AutoGPTQ
git checkout v0.5.1
pip3 install .
```

### Example Python code

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model_name_or_path = "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ"
# To use a different branch, change revision
# For example: revision="gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path,
                                             device_map="auto",
                                             trust_remote_code=False,
                                             revision="main")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, use_fast=True)

prompt = "Tell me about AI"
prompt_template=f'''<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]
'''

print("\n\n*** Generate:")

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors='pt').input_ids.cuda()
output = model.generate(inputs=input_ids, temperature=0.7, do_sample=True, top_p=0.95, top_k=40, max_new_tokens=512)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))

# Inference can also be done using transformers' pipeline

print("*** Pipeline:")
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.95,
    top_k=40,
    repetition_penalty=1.1
)

print(pipe(prompt_template)[0]['generated_text'])

# Original model card: Mistral AI_'s Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2


# Model Card for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is an improved instruct fine-tuned version of [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1).

For full details of this model please read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825) and [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/).

## Instruction format

In order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should be surrounded by `[INST]` and `[/INST]` tokens. The very first instruction should begin with a begin of sentence id. The next instructions should not. The assistant generation will be ended by the end-of-sentence token id.

E.g.
```
text = "<s>[INST] What is your favourite condiment? [/INST]"
"Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!</s> "
"[INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST]"
```

This format is available as a [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating) via the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"}
]

encodeds = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")

model_inputs = encodeds.to(device)
model.to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=1000, do_sample=True)
decoded = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)
print(decoded[0])
```

## Model Architecture
This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices:
- Grouped-Query Attention
- Sliding-Window Attention
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

## Troubleshooting
- If you see the following error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/transformers/models/auto/auto_factory.py", line 482, in from_pretrained
config, kwargs = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 1022, in from_pretrained
config_class = CONFIG_MAPPING[config_dict["model_type"]]
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 723, in getitem
raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'mistral'
```

Installing transformers from source should solve the issue
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

This should not be required after transformers-v4.33.4.

## Limitations

The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. 
It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to
make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
