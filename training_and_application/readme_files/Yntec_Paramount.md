# Paramount Alpha & Beta

I produced these merges to make one involving Analog Diffusion, to have distinct outputs. Originally the diffusers version was based on Paramount Alpha, after testing it was clear it should be based on this one instead. Then I renamed it as the Beta version when I added Analog Diffusion in.
