This is new updated version of Moirai-1.0-R (https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/moirai-1.0-R-base).
The new Moirai model achieved significant improvements (~20%) for low-frequency cases like Yearly and Quarterly data in Normalised Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) for 40 datasets on the Monash repository.
