# Marigold Normals (LCM) Model Card

This model belongs to the family of diffusion-based Marigold models for solving various computer vision tasks.
The Marigold Normals model focuses on the surface normals task.
It takes an input image and computes surface normals in each pixel.
The LCM stands for Latent Consistency Models, which is a technique for making the diffusion model fast.
The Marigold Normals model is trained from Stable Diffusion with synthetic data, and the LCM model is further fine-tuned from it.
Thanks to the rich visual knowledge stored in Stable Diffusion, Marigold models possess deep scene understanding and excel at solving computer vision tasks.
