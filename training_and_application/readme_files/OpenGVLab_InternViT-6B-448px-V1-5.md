We develop InternViT-6B-448px-V1-5 based on the pre-training of the strong foundation of [InternViT-6B-448px-V1-2](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternViT-6B-448px-V1-2). In this update, the resolution of training images is expanded from 448&times;448 to dynamic 448&times;448, where the basic tile size is 448&times;448 and the number of tiles ranges from 1 to 12.
Additionally, we enhance the data scale, quality, and diversity of the pre-training dataset, resulting in the powerful robustness, OCR capability, and high-resolution processing capability of our
1.5 version model. 

## Model Details
- **Model Type:** vision foundation model, feature backbone
- **Model Stats:**
  - Params (M): 5540 (the last 3 blocks are discarded)
  - Image size: 448 x 448, training with 1 - 12 tiles
- **Pretrain Dataset:** LAION-en, LAION-zh, COYO, GRIT, COCO, TextCaps, Objects365, OpenImages, All-Seeing, Wukong-OCR, LaionCOCO-OCR, and other OCR-related datasets. 
To enhance the OCR capability of the model, we have incorporated additional OCR data alongside the general caption datasets. Specifically, we utilized PaddleOCR to perform Chinese OCR on images from Wukong and English OCR on images from LAION-COCO. 
- **Note:** InternViT-6B originally had 48 blocks, and we found that using the output after the fourth-to-last block worked best for MLLM. For ease of use and to save GPU memory, we simply discarded the last 3 blocks. Now, the model has only 45 blocks and the number of parameters has been reduced from 5.9B to 5.5B. Therefore, if you want to build a MLLM based on this model, **please make use of the features from the last layer.**

## Model Usage (Image Embeddings)

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, CLIPImageProcessor

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    'OpenGVLab/InternViT-6B-448px-V1-5',
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True).cuda().eval()

image = Image.open('./examples/image1.jpg').convert('RGB')

image_processor = CLIPImageProcessor.from_pretrained('OpenGVLab/InternViT-6B-448px-V1-5')

pixel_values = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors='pt').pixel_values
pixel_values = pixel_values.to(torch.bfloat16).cuda()

outputs = model(pixel_values)
```
