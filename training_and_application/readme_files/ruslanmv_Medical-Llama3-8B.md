    content: How long does it take for newborn jaundice to go away?
  output:
    text: >-
      Newborn jaundice, also known as neonatal jaundice, is a common condition
      in newborns where the yellowing of the skin and eyes occurs due to an
      elevated level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment
      that forms when red blood cells break down. In most cases, newborn
      jaundice resolves on its own without any specific treatment.
      The duration of newborn jaundice can vary depending on several factors
      such as the underlying cause, gestational age at birth, and individual
      variations in bilirubin metabolism. Here are some general guidelines

# Medical-Llama3-8B-16bit: Fine-Tuned Llama3 for Medical Q&A
[![](future.jpg)](https://ruslanmv.com/)
This repository provides a fine-tuned version of the powerful Llama3 8B model, specifically designed to answer medical questions in an informative way. It leverages the rich knowledge contained in the AI Medical Chatbot dataset ([ruslanmv/ai-medical-chatbot](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ruslanmv/ai-medical-chatbot)).

**Model & Development**

- **Developed by:** ruslanmv
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Finetuned from model:** meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B

**Key Features**

- **Medical Focus:** Optimized to address health-related inquiries.
- **Knowledge Base:** Trained on a comprehensive medical chatbot dataset.
- **Text Generation:** Generates informative and potentially helpful responses.

**Installation**

This model is accessible through the Hugging Face Transformers library. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers   bitsandbytes  accelerate
```

**Usage Example**

Here's a Python code snippet demonstrating how to interact with the `Medical-Llama3-8B-16bit` model and generate answers to your medical questions:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch
model_name = "ruslanmv/Medical-Llama3-8B"
device_map = 'auto'
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True, bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained( model_name,quantization_config=bnb_config, trust_remote_code=True,use_cache=False,device_map=device_map)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

def askme(question):
    sys_message = ''' 
    You are an AI Medical Assistant trained on a vast dataset of health information. Please be thorough and
    provide an informative answer. If you don't know the answer to a specific medical inquiry, advise seeking professional help.
    '''   
    # Create messages structured for the chat template
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": sys_message}, {"role": "user", "content": question}]
    
    # Applying chat template
    prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100, use_cache=True)
    
    # Extract and return the generated text, removing the prompt
    response_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0].strip()
    answer = response_text.split('<|im_start|>assistant')[-1].strip()
    return answer
# Example usage
# - Context: First describe your problem.
# - Question: Then make the question.

question = '''I'm a 35-year-old male and for the past few months, I've been experiencing fatigue, 
increased sensitivity to cold, and dry, itchy skin. 
Could these symptoms be related to hypothyroidism? 
If so, what steps should I take to get a proper diagnosis and discuss treatment options?'''

print(askme(question))

```
the type of answer is :
```
Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism. 
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones, leading to a variety of symptoms. 
Some common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry skin. 
If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. 
Your doctor may order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels
