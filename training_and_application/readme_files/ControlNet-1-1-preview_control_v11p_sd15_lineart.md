# Controlnet - v1.1 - *lineart Version*

**Controlnet v1.1** is the successor model of [Controlnet v1.0](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet)
and was released in [lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1) by [Lvmin Zhang](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel).

This checkpoint is a conversion of [the original checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/blob/main/control_v11p_sd15_lineart.pth) into `diffusers` format.
It can be used in combination with **Stable Diffusion**, such as [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5).


For more details, please also have a look at the [ðŸ§¨ Diffusers docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/controlnet).


ControlNet is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

This checkpoint corresponds to the ControlNet conditioned on **lineart images**.

## Introduction

Controlnet was proposed in [*Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543) by 
Lvmin Zhang, Maneesh Agrawala.

The abstract reads as follows:

*We present a neural network structure, ControlNet, to control pretrained large diffusion models to support additional input conditions. 
The ControlNet learns task-specific conditions in an end-to-end way, and the learning is robust even when the training dataset is small (< 50k). 
Moreover, training a ControlNet is as fast as fine-tuning a diffusion model, and the model can be trained on a personal devices. 
Alternatively, if powerful computation clusters are available, the model can scale to large amounts (millions to billions) of data. 
We report that large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be augmented with ControlNets to enable conditional inputs like edge maps, segmentation maps, keypoints, etc. 
This may enrich the methods to control large diffusion models and further facilitate related applications.*

## Example

It is recommended to use the checkpoint with [Stable Diffusion v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) as the checkpoint 
has been trained on it.
Experimentally, the checkpoint can be used with other diffusion models such as dreamboothed stable diffusion.

**Note**: If you want to process an image to create the auxiliary conditioning, external dependencies are required as shown below:

1. Install https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/controlnet_aux

```sh
$ pip install controlnet_aux==0.3.0
```

2. Let's install `diffusers` and related packages:

```
$ pip install diffusers transformers accelerate
```

3. Run code:

```python
import torch
import os
from huggingface_hub import HfApi
from pathlib import Path
from diffusers.utils import load_image
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
from controlnet_aux import LineartDetector

from diffusers import (
    ControlNetModel,
    StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline,
    UniPCMultistepScheduler,
)

checkpoint = "ControlNet-1-1-preview/control_v11p_sd15_lineart"

image = load_image(
    "https://huggingface.co/ControlNet-1-1-preview/control_v11p_sd15_lineart/resolve/main/images/input.png"
)
image = image.resize((512, 512))

prompt = "michael jackson concert"
processor = LineartDetector.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/Annotators")

control_image = processor(image)
control_image.save("./images/control.png")

controlnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", controlnet=controlnet, torch_dtype=torch.float16
)

pipe.scheduler = UniPCMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

generator = torch.manual_seed(0)
image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=30, generator=generator, image=control_image).images[0]

image.save('images/image_out.png')

```

## Other released checkpoints v1-1

The authors released 14 different checkpoints, each trained with [Stable Diffusion v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) 
on a different type of conditioning:
