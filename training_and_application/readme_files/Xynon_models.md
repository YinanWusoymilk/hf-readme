Where Xynon's experimental models and TIs live.

I do not guarantee any of the models in this repo work as intended, you are in here at your own expense.

If you're here, you're probably here for either bad-image or the latest experimental model.
(you saw the images from somewhere ;)

**MODEL STATUS**:

experimental5, experimental9, experimental9-2, experimental10: all 1 month old, obsolete

**experimental12b:** current main model, combined with bad-image-v2-(39000)

experimental13t: broken unless you use clip skip 4, otherwise generates mosaics

extestd4b: ultra-experimental, for Niakonichan.pt's food ;)
