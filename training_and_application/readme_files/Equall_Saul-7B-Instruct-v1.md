## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

This is the model card of a ðŸ¤— transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub. This model card has been automatically generated.

- **Developed by:**  Equall.ai in collaboration with CentraleSupelec, Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico and NOVA School of Law
- **Model type:** 7B
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** MIT

### Model Sources

<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->

- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03883

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->
You can use it for legal use cases that involves generation.

Here's how you can run the model using the pipeline() function from ðŸ¤— Transformers:

```python

# Install transformers from source - only needed for versions <= v4.34
# pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
# pip install accelerate

import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="Equall/Saul-Instruct-v1", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
# We use the tokenizerâ€™s chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "[YOUR QUERY GOES HERE]"},
]
prompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=False)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])
```

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->


This model is built upon the technology of LLM, which comes with inherent limitations. It may occasionally generate inaccurate or nonsensical outputs. Furthermore, being a 7B model, it's anticipated to exhibit less robust performance compared to larger models, such as the 70B variant.
