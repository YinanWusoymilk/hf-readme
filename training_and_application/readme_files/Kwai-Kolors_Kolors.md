## 📖 Introduction
Kolors is a large-scale text-to-image generation model based on latent diffusion, developed by the Kuaishou Kolors team. Trained on billions of text-image pairs, Kolors exhibits significant advantages over both open-source and proprietary models in visual quality, complex semantic accuracy, and text rendering for both Chinese and English characters. Furthermore, Kolors supports both Chinese and English inputs, demonstrating strong performance in understanding and generating Chinese-specific content. For more details, please refer to this <a href="https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors/blob/master/imgs/Kolors_paper.pdf">technical report</a></b>.


## 🚀 Quick Start
### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or later
* PyTorch 1.13.1 or later
* Transformers 4.26.1 or later
* Recommended: CUDA 11.7 or later
<br>

1. Repository cloning and dependency installation

```bash
apt-get install git-lfs
git clone https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors
cd Kolors
conda create --name kolors python=3.8
conda activate kolors
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```
2. Weights download（[link](https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors)）：
```bash
huggingface-cli download --resume-download Kwai-Kolors/Kolors --local-dir weights/Kolors
```
or
```bash
git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors weights/Kolors
```
3. Inference：
```bash
python3 scripts/sample.py "一张瓢虫的照片，微距，变焦，高质量，电影，拿着一个牌子，写着“可图”"
# The image will be saved to "scripts/outputs/sample_test.jpg"
```
