# Mitsua Diffusion One Model Card

Mitsua Diffusion One is a latent text-to-image diffusion model, which is a successor of [Mitsua Diffusion CC0](https://huggingface.co/Mitsua/mitsua-diffusion-cc0).

This model is **trained from scratch using only public domain/CC0 or copyright images with permission for use**, with using a fixed pretrained text encoder ([OpenCLIP ViT-H/14](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip), MIT License). 

This will be used as a base model for [**AI VTuber Elan MitsuaüñåÔ∏è**](https://elanmitsua.com/en/)‚Äôs activity. 

‚ùó‚ùó **Currently, the model is still of low quality and lacks diversity** ‚ùó‚ùó

## Further training will be done fully opt-in basis.

If you are interested in, [please click here to submit an opt-in application](https://forms.gle/Nk3M7UyqSgYAqdpA6).

We are active on [a Discord server for opt-in contributors only](https://discord.com/invite/7VTGRweTUg). Communication is currently in Japanese.

‚ùó‚ùó **To train this model, images from opt-in contributors have not yet been used** ‚ùó‚ùó

## License
- Mitsua Open RAIL-M License (More restrictive variant of CreativeML Open RAIL-M)

This model is open access and available to all, with a Mitsua Open RAIL-M license further specifying rights and usage. The Mitsua Open RAIL-M License specifies:

1. You can't use the model to deliberately produce nor share illegal or harmful outputs or content
2. The authors claims no rights on the outputs you generate, you are free to use them and are accountable for their use which must not go against the provisions set in the license
3. You can't use the model to infringe any rights of other by feeding image sources or model weights to the model (e.g. using another person's copyrighted image for fine-tuning without permission, using another person's copyrighted image as a source for image2image without permission). 
4. You can't misrepresent that a generated image as not AI-generated.
5. You may re-distribute the weights and use the model commercially and/or as a service. If you do, please be aware you have to include the same use restrictions as the ones in the license and share a copy of the Mitsua Open RAIL-M to all your users (please read the license entirely and carefully) [Please read the full license here](https://huggingface.co/Mitsua/mitsua-diffusion-one/blob/main/MODEL-LICENSE)

## Training Data Sources

## Training Notes
- Trained resolution : 256x256 --> 512x512 --> (512x512, 640x448, 448x640) --> (512x512, 768x512, 512x768)
- diffusers version and `mitsua-diffusion-one.ckpt` are fine-tuned with [Diffusion With Offset Noise](https://www.crosslabs.org/blog/diffusion-with-offset-noise) technique which is applied to last 12k steps with `p=0.02`.
- `mitsua-diffusion-one-base.ckpt` is non-fine-tuned version. For fine-tuning stuff, this version would be better choice.

## Cosine similarity (as a proof of full-scratch training)
- VAE
  - 0.16694325 (vs Stable Diffusion v2.1 base)
  - 0.20887965 (vs Stable Diffusion v.1.4)
  - All fine-tuned variant would have over 0.90
- U-Net
  - 0.07097270 (vs Stable Diffusion v2.1 base)
  - 0.08351029 (vs Stable Diffusion v.1.4)
  - All fine-tuned variant would have over 0.99
