This model is based on StarCoder2-15b and is subject to bigcode-openrail-m license.

This Dolphin is *really good* at coding, I trained with a lot of coding data.  

This model is uncensored.  I have filtered the dataset to remove alignment and bias.  This makes the model more compliant.  You are advised to implement your own alignment layer before exposing the model as a service.  It will be highly compliant to any requests, even unethical ones.  Please read my blog post about uncensored models.  https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models
You are responsible for any content you create using this model.  Enjoy responsibly.

## Training
It took 3 days to train 3 epochs on 8x H100s using qLoRA and Axolotl

Prompt format:
This model uses ChatML prompt format.
```
<|im_start|>system
You are DolphinCoder, a helpful AI programming assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Example:
```
<|im_start|>system
You are DolphinCoder, a master at software engineering and coding in any programming language.
<|im_start|>user
Please write me a program in golang that parses all the lines in a file, and reverses them character-wise, and saves it to a new file.
<|im_start|>assistant
```
