# Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct

## Introduction

Over the past year, we have dedicated significant effort to researching and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with a particular focus on their ability to solve arithmetic and mathematical problems. Today, we are delighted to introduce a serise of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series,  Qwen2-Math and Qwen2-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. Qwen2-Math is a series of specialized math language models built upon the Qwen2 LLMs, which significantly outperforms the mathematical capabilities of open-source models and even closed-source models (e.g., GPT4o). We hope that Qwen2-Math can contribute to the scientific community for solving advanced mathematical problems that require complex, multi-step logical reasoning.


## Model Details


For more details, please refer to our [blog post](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-math/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-Math).


## Requirements
* `transformers>=4.40.0` for Qwen2-Math models. The latest version is recommended.

> [!Warning]
> <div align="center">
> <b>
> 🚨 This is a must because `transformers` integrated Qwen2 codes since `4.37.0`.
> </b>
> </div>

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see similar results of Qwen2 [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).

## Quick Start

> [!Important]
>
> **Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct** is an instruction model for chatting;
>
> **Qwen2-Math-72B** is a base model typically used for completion and few-shot inference, serving as a better starting point for fine-tuning.

### 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers

Qwen2-Math can be deployed and infered in the same way as [Qwen2](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2). Here we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with `transformers`:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct"
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "Find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $4x+5 = 6x+7$."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

### 🤖 ModelScope
We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. `snapshot_download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.
