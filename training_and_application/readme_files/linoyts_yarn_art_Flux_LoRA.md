# Flux DreamBooth LoRA - linoyts/yarn_art_flux_1_700_custom

<Gallery />

## Model description

These are linoyts/yarn_art_flux_1_700_custom DreamBooth LoRA weights for black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev.

The weights were trained using [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) with the [Flux diffusers trainer](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/README_flux.md).

Was LoRA for the text encoder enabled? False.

## Trigger words

You should use `yarn art style` to trigger the image generation.

## Download model

[Download the *.safetensors LoRA](linoyts/yarn_art_flux_1_700_custom/tree/main) in the Files & versions tab.

## Use it with the [ðŸ§¨ diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

```py
from diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image
import torch
pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to('cuda')
pipeline.load_lora_weights('linoyts/yarn_art_flux_1_700_custom', weight_name='pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors')
image = pipeline('a Yarn art style tarot card').images[0]
```

For more details, including weighting, merging and fusing LoRAs, check the [documentation on loading LoRAs in diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/using-diffusers/loading_adapters)
