# Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored float16 HF

This is a float16 HF repo for [Eric Hartford's 'uncensored' training of Wizard-Vicuna 13B](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored).

It is the result of converting Eric's float32 repo to float16 for easier storage and use.

## Repositories available

* [4bit GPTQ models for GPU inference](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-GPTQ).
* [4bit and 5bit GGML models for CPU inference](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-GGML).
* [float16 HF format model for GPU inference and further conversions](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-HF).

## Thanks, and how to contribute.

Thanks to the [chirper.ai](https://chirper.ai) team!

I've had a lot of people ask if they can contribute. I enjoy providing models and helping people, and would love to be able to spend even more time doing it, as well as expanding into new projects like fine tuning/training.

If you're able and willing to contribute it will be most gratefully received and will help me to keep providing more models, and to start work on new AI projects.

Donaters will get priority support on any and all AI/LLM/model questions and requests, access to a private Discord room, plus other benefits.

# Original model card

This is [wizard-vicuna-13b](https://huggingface.co/junelee/wizard-vicuna-13b) trained with a subset of the dataset - responses that contained alignment / moralizing were removed. The intent is to train a WizardLM that doesn't have alignment built-in, so that alignment (of any sort) can be added separately with for example with a RLHF LoRA.

Shout out to the open source AI/ML community, and everyone who helped me out.

Note:

An uncensored model has no guardrails.

You are responsible for anything you do with the model, just as you are responsible for anything you do with any dangerous object such as a knife, gun, lighter, or car.

Publishing anything this model generates is the same as publishing it yourself.

You are responsible for the content you publish, and you cannot blame the model any more than you can blame the knife, gun, lighter, or car for what you do with it.
