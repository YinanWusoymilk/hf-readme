# CrystalCoder

<center><img src="crystalcoder_logo.jpg" alt="crystal coder logo" width="300"/></center>


Crystal is a 7B parameter language model, distinctively trained on the SlimPajama and StarCoder datasets. 
This model excels in balancing natural language processing and coding capabilities. 
Despite being trained on a smaller dataset of 1.4 trillion tokensâ€”compared to LLaMA 2's 2 trillionâ€”Crystal surpasses LLaMA 2 in some challenging English and coding tasks. 
It demonstrates superior performance in benchmarks like MMLU, HumanEval, and MBPP. 
By comparing Crystal with other similar work, Crystal is quite balance on language and coding tasks. Crystal is part of LLM360's Pebble model series.

Note: Crystal was formerly known as CrystalCoder.

**Notes**

- We compute all evaluation metrics ourselves. 

- Language benchmarks are computed following the convention of [the Huggingface Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), which means AI2 Reasoning Challenge in 25-shot, HellaSwag in 10-shot, MMLU computed in 5-shot, TruthfulQA in 0-shot. 

- As reported in prior work, the choice of temperature affect the programming metrics a lot, we evaluate all models with the following temperature:
   - Scores for HumanEval is computed with a temperature of 0.2
   - Scores for MBPP is computed with a temperature of 0.1
- For detailed token breakdown of Crystal dataset, refer to the [Crystal dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/CrystalCoderDatasets).


 
## About LLM360
LLM360 is an initiative for comprehensive and fully open-sourced LLMs, 
where all training details, model checkpoints, intermediate results, and 
additional analyses are made available to the community. Our goal is to advance 
the field by inviting the community to deepen the understanding of LLMs 
together. As the first step of the project LLM360, we release all intermediate 
model checkpoints, our fully-prepared pre-training dataset, all source code and
configurations, and training details. We are
committed to continually pushing the boundaries of LLMs through this open-source 
effort.

# ðŸŸ£ Model Architecture

Crystal leverages a GPT-like architecture, akin to LLaMA, but with the addition of maximal update parameterization (**muP**). 

Key modifications introduced by muP include:

1. Input embeddings are scaled by `mup_embeddings_scale`.
2. Output logits are scaled by `mup_output_alpha` * `mup_width_scale`.
3. Attention weights scaling is refined to division by the hidden dimension size (`(QK^T)/d`) instead of its square root (`(QK^T)/sqrt(d)`).
4. Learning rates and weight decay are optimized for different parameter groups:
   - Embedding layer: LR=`BASE_LR`, WD=`BASE_WD`.
   - Normalization layers: LR=`BASE_LR`, WD=0.
   - Other Parameters: LR=`BASE_LR` * `mup_width_scale`, WD=`BASE_WD`.
5. Initialization ranges are determined based on muP hyperparameters.

The muP hyperparameters are set as follows:

- `mup_embeddings_scale`: 14.6
- `mup_output_alpha`: 2.22
- `mup_width_scale`: 0.0625

For other architecture choices:
- We use `LayerNorm` instead of `RMSNorm`.
- Rotary position embeddings applied to only the first `25%` of hidden dimensions.
- Training sequence length is `2048`.
- Embedding dimension is `32032`.

# ðŸŸ£ Tokenization

Our tokenizer is based on the LLaMA tokenizer, with 22 additional special tokens for the following usage:
- 4 filling-in-middle (FIM) tokens such as `<|fim_prefix|>` to support FIM inference.
- 14 spcial tokens such as `<|filename|>`, `<|jupyter_start|>`, `<|reponame|>` to support meta data for code dataset following StarCoder's method.
- 4 special tokens such as `<|sys_start|>`, `<|im_start|>` to support instruction tuning.

Therefore, we extended the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary size from `32000` to `32032`. Some token ids are reserved and not used.

# ðŸŸ£   Training

Our training has 3 stages:
- Stage 1: Pretraining on first half of SlimPajama (50% x 690B = 345B).
- Stage 2: Pretraining on the other half of SlimPajama (50% x 690B = 345B), plus two epochs of StarCoder Data (2 x 291B).
- Stage 3: Pretraining on `100B` additional Python and web-related data (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) sampled from StarCoder Data, and `10B` tokens sampled from SlimPajama.

For details of the training dataset for each stage, please refer to the Dataset section and our Crystal Data Card.

# ðŸŸ£ Dataset

Our tokenized datasets for all phases are available at [CrystalDatasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/CrystalCoderDatasets).


# ðŸŸ£ Model Usage

To load a specific checkpoint, use the revision argument as shown below, for example, `CrystalCoder_phase1_checkpoint_055500`. All the revisions can be seen from the branch dropdown in the "Files and versions" tab. If no revision argument is provided, it will load the phase 3 final checkpoint `CrystalCoder_phase3_checkpoint_027728`.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "LLM360/CrystalCoder",
    revision="CrystalCoder_phase1_checkpoint_055500",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "LLM360/CrystalCoder",
    revision="CrystalCoder_phase1_checkpoint_055500",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

prompt = 'int add(int x, int y) {'

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
gen_tokens = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, max_length=400)

print("-"*20 + "Output for model"  + 20 * '-')
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_tokens)[0])
```

>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) True """
    pass

# Fill in this function. It should return the index into `numbers` where the closest pair should be inserted.
def closest_pair(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> int:

    Assumes all the numbers are numbers in the list are positive.
    Returns the correct index into `numbers` where the closest pair should be inserted. This
    number is the *first* element of the closest pair.

>>> closest_pair([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.25) 1
>>> closest_pair([12.8, 12.0], 0.0) 0
