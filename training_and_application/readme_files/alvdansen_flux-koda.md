## Model description 

Koda captures the nostalgic essence of early 1990s photography, evoking memories of disposable cameras and carefree travels. It specializes in creating images with a distinct vintage quality, characterized by slightly washed-out colors, soft focus, and the occasional light leak or film grain. The model excels at producing slice-of-life scenes that feel spontaneous and candid, as if plucked from a family photo album or a backpacker&#39;s travel diary. 

Words that can highlight interesting nuances within the model:

kodachrome, blurry, realistic, still life, depth of field, scenery, no humans, monochrome, greyscale, traditional media, horizon, looking at viewer, light particles, shadow
