**Model creator:** [Google](https://huggingface.co/google)<br>
**Original model**: [gemma-2-2b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b-it)<br>
**GGUF quantization:** provided by [bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) based on `llama.cpp` release [b3496](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b3496)<br>

## Model Summary:
Gemma 2 instruct is a a brand new model from Google in the Gemma family based on the technology from Gemini. Trained on a combination of web documents, code, and mathematics, this model should excel at anything you throw at it.<br>
At only 2b parameters, this is a great size for edge and low power compute, or as an autocomplete or draft model.

## Prompt Template:

Choose the 'Google Gemma Instruct' preset in your LM Studio. 

Under the hood, the model will see a prompt that's formatted like so:

```
<start_of_turn>user
{prompt}<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model
```

Note that this model does not support a System prompt.

## Technical Details

Gemma 2 features the same extremely large vocabulary from release 1.1, which tends to help with multilingual and coding proficiency.

Gemma 2 2b was trained on a wide dataset of 2 trillion tokens, which is an incredible ratio of training tokens to model parameters.

- Web Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. Primarily English-language content.
- Code: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate code or understand code-related questions.
- Mathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical reasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.
