**She's back!**

Stheno's Sister Model, designed to impress.

```
- Same Dataset used as Stheno v3.2 -> See notes there.
- LoRA Fine-Tune -> FFT is simply too expensive.
- Trained over 8x H100 SXMs and then some more afterwards.
```

**Testing Notes**
```
- Better prompt adherence.
- Better anatomy / spatial awareness.
- Adapts much better to unique and custom formatting / reply formats.
- Very creative, lots of unique swipes.
- Is not restrictive during roleplays. 
- Feels like a big brained version of Stheno.
```

*Likely due to it being a 70B model instead of 8B. Similar vibes comparing back in llama 2, where 70B models were simply much more 'aware' in the subtler areas and contexts a smaller model like a 7B or 13B simply were not able to handle.*
