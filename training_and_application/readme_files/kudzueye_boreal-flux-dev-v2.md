    Amateur selfie photo of two young women at an anime convention on a hot
    summer day. The first woman, of Japanese descent, has long black hair styled
    into pigtails and is wearing a colorful anime-themed cosplay outfit,
    featuring a vibrant, detailed costume with matching accessories. The second
    woman, of Hispanic descent, has curly brown hair tied up in a high ponytail
    and is dressed in a casual yet trendy anime-themed t-shirt and shorts. Both
    women are smiling widely at the camera, holding it at arm's length. In the
    background, the convention is bustling with activity: attendees in various
    cosplay costumes, vendor booths with anime merchandise, and colorful banners
    hanging overhead. The sunlight is bright, casting a warm glow over the
    scene, with a few people seeking shade under tents. The image captures the
    enthusiastic atmosphere of the convention and the joy of the two women
    enjoying their time at the event. On Flickr, 2022.

## Model description 

**Boreal Flux Dev Version 2**
This version of the **Bo**ing **Real**ity flux dev LoRA used a different training approach for its dataset. It should also have the old latent shift dot issue fixed.

This LoRA is very overtrained for how it works and the strength may need to be much lower than 1.0. It also works well with dynamic thresholding when you include a very high negative guidance.

This version lacks some of the creativity of the older version, as I am still trying to switch up how I am approaching the datasets and training parameters.

## Trigger words

You should use `photo` to trigger the image generation.


## Download model

Weights for this model are available in Safetensors format.
