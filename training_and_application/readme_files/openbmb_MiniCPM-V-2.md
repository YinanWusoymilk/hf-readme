## MiniCPM-V 2.0


**MiniCPM-V 2.8B** is a strong multimodal large language model for efficient end-side deployment. The model is built based on SigLip-400M and [MiniCPM-2.4B](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM/), connected by a perceiver resampler. Our latest version, **MiniCPM-V 2.0** has several notable features. 

- üî• **State-of-the-art Performance.** 

  MiniCPM-V 2.0 achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on multiple benchmarks (including OCRBench, TextVQA, MME, MMB, MathVista, etc) among models under 7B parameters. It even **outperforms strong Qwen-VL-Chat 9.6B, CogVLM-Chat 17.4B, and Yi-VL 34B on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation over 11 popular benchmarks**. Notably, MiniCPM-V 2.0 shows **strong OCR capability**, achieving **comparable performance to Gemini Pro in scene-text understanding**, and **state-of-the-art performance on OCRBench** among open-source models.

- üèÜ **Trustworthy Behavior.** 

  LMMs are known for suffering from hallucination, often generating text not factually grounded in images. MiniCPM-V 2.0 is **the first end-side LMM aligned via multimodal RLHF for trustworthy behavior** (using the recent [RLHF-V](https://rlhf-v.github.io/) [CVPR'24] series technique). This allows the model to **match GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations** on Object HalBench.

- üåü **High-Resolution Images at Any Aspect Raito.**

  MiniCPM-V 2.0 can accept **1.8 million pixels (e.g., 1344x1344) images at any aspect ratio**. This enables better perception of fine-grained visual information such as small objects and optical characters, which is achieved via a recent technique from [LLaVA-UHD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11703.pdf).

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **High Efficiency.** 

  MiniCPM-V 2.0 can be **efficiently deployed on most GPU cards and personal computers**, and **even on end devices such as mobile phones**. For visual encoding, we compress the image representations into much fewer tokens via a perceiver resampler. This allows MiniCPM-V 2.0 to operate with **favorable memory cost and speed during inference even when dealing with high-resolution images**.



- üôå **Bilingual Support.** 

  MiniCPM-V 2.0 **supports strong bilingual multimodal capabilities in both English and Chinese**. This is enabled by generalizing multimodal capabilities across languages, a technique from [VisCPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12038) [ICLR'24].

## Inference with vLLM<a id="vllm"></a>

<details>
<summary>Click to see how to inference with vLLM </summary>
Because our pull request to vLLM is still waiting for reviewing, we fork this repository to build and test our vLLM demo. Here are the steps:

1. Clone our version of vLLM:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/vllm.git
```
2. Install vLLM:
```shell
cd vllm
pip install -e .
```
3. Install timm: 
```shell
pip install timm=0.9.10
```
4. Run our demo:
```shell
python examples/minicpmv_example.py 
```

```
Pillow==10.1.0
timm==0.9.10
torch==2.1.2
torchvision==0.16.2
transformers==4.36.0
sentencepiece==0.1.99

from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2', trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
# For Nvidia GPUs support BF16 (like A100, H100, RTX3090)
model = model.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16)
# For Nvidia GPUs do NOT support BF16 (like V100, T4, RTX2080)
#model = model.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
# For Mac with MPS (Apple silicon or AMD GPUs).
# Run with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python test.py`
#model = model.to(device='mps', dtype=torch.float16)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2', trust_remote_code=True)
model.eval()

image = Image.open('xx.jpg').convert('RGB')
question = 'What is in the image?'
msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]

res, context, _ = model.chat(
    image=image,
