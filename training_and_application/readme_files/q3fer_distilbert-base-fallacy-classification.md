# distilbert-base-fallacy-classification

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the [Logical Fallacy Dataset](https://github.com/causalNLP/logical-fallacy).

## Model description

The model is fine-tuned for text classification of logical fallacies. There are a total of 14 classes: ad hominem, ad populum, appeal to emotion, circular reasoning, equivocation, fallacy of credibility, fallacy of extension, fallacy of logic, fallacy of relevance, false causality, false dilemma, faulty generalization, intentional, and miscellaneous.

## Example Pipeline

```python
from transformers import pipeline

text = "We know that the earth is flat because it looks and feels flat."
model_path = "q3fer/distilbert-base-fallacy-classification"
pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=model_path, tokenizer=model_path)
pipe(text)
```

```
[{'label': 'circular reasoning', 'score': 0.951125979423523}]
```

## Full Classification Example

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("q3fer/distilbert-base-fallacy-classification")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("q3fer/distilbert-base-fallacy-classification")

text = "We know that the earth is flat because it looks and feels flat."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')

with torch.no_grad():
  logits = model(**inputs)
  scores = logits[0][0]
  scores = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=0)(scores)

  _, ranking = torch.topk(scores, k=scores.shape[0])
  ranking = ranking.tolist()

results = [f"{i+1}) {model.config.id2label[ranking[i]]} {scores[ranking[i]]:.4f}" for i in range(scores.shape[0])]
print('\n'.join(results))
```

```
1) circular reasoning 0.9511
