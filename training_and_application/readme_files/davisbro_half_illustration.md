# Create unique half illustrated, half photo images

<Gallery />

## Model description 

Flux Dev 1 model that creates images with both photographic and illustrative elements. Pretty cool right? You can also run the model on Replicate. Let me know your thoughts and have a wonderful day!

https://replicate.com/davisbrown/flux-half-illustration


## Trigger words

It would help if you usedÂ `in the style of TOK`Â for better style preservation. It is best to place the trigger words first and describe illustrative elements in your scene like clothing or expressive elements.

# Flux Multi Angle

Trained on Replicate using:
https://replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer/train

## Download model

[Download the *.safetensors LoRA](https://huggingface.co/davisbro/half_illustration/tree/main) in the Files & versions tab.

## Use it with the [ðŸ§¨ diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

```py
from diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image
import torch
pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to('cuda')
pipeline.load_lora_weights('davisbro/half_illustration', weight_name='flux_train_replicate.safetensors')
image = pipeline('A 50mm bokeh photo of a fashion show in paris, midday sun, surrounded by the colorful friendly rock and roll text "Paris" and other french themed doodles').images[0]
```
