## Introduction

The Imp project aims to provide a family of  a strong multimodal `small` language models (MSLMs). Our `imp-v1-3b` is a strong MSLM with only **3B** parameters, which is build upon a small yet powerful SLM [Phi-2 ](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2)(2.7B) and a powerful visual encoder [SigLIP ](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384)(0.4B), and trained on the [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) training set.  

As shown in the image below, `imp-v1-3b` significantly outperforms the counterparts of similar model sizes, and even achieves slightly better performance than the strong LLaVA-7B model on various multimodal benchmarks.

We release our model weights and provide an example below to run our model . Detailed technical report and corresponding training/evaluation code will be released soon on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MILVLG/imp). We will persistently improve our model and release the next versions to further improve model performance :) 


## How to use


**Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install transformers # latest version is ok, but we recommend v4.39.2
pip install -q pillow accelerate einops
```

You can use the following code for model inference. The format of text instruction is similar to [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). A Colab page to run this example is provided [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EBYky6xIPjnlPppo2gZaiNK6gEsjXgom?usp=drive_link#scrollTo=2-VpU6QzWCVZ). Note that the example can only be run on GPUs currently.

```Python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from PIL import Image

torch.set_default_device("cuda")

#Create model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "MILVLG/imp-v1-3b", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("MILVLG/imp-v1-3b", trust_remote_code=True)

#Set inputs
text = "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: <image>\nWhat are the colors of the bus in the image? ASSISTANT:"
image = Image.open("images/bus.jpg")

input_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt').input_ids
image_tensor = model.image_preprocess(image)

#Generate the answer
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=100,
    images=image_tensor,
    use_cache=True)[0]
print(tokenizer.decode(output_ids[input_ids.shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip())
```

## Model evaluation
We conduct evaluation on 9 commonly-used benchmarks, including 5 academic VQA benchmarks and 4 popular MLLM benchmarks, to compare our Imp model with LLaVA (7B) and existing MSLMs of similar model sizes.

## About us
This project is maintained by the [MILVLG](https://github.com/MILVLG)@Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) led by Prof. Zhou Yu and Jun Yu, and is mainly developed by Zhenwei Shao and Xuecheng Ouyang. We hope our model may serve as a strong baseline to inspire future research on MSLM, as well as its derivative applications on mobile devices and robots.
