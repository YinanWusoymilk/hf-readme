Adjacent to the bed, a dresser stands tall, hosting a mirror, a vase, and a flower arrangement. A chair is positioned near the dresser, offering a comfortable spot to sit and relax. The room is adorned with a large window that offers a picturesque view of trees outside. The walls are painted in a soothing shade of white, enhancing the overall ambiance of the space."

## Description 

UForm-Gen is a small generative vision-language model primarily designed for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering. The model consists of two parts: 

1. CLIP-like ViT-H/14
2. [Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat)

The model was pre-trained on the internal image captioning dataset and fine-tuned on public instructions datasets: SVIT, LVIS, VQAs datasets.
The model took one day to train on a DGX-H100 with 8x H100 GPUs.
Thanks to [Nebius.ai](https://nebius.ai) for providing the compute ðŸ¤—

### Usage


The generative model can be used to caption images, answer questions about them. Also it is suitable for a multimodal chat.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("unum-cloud/uform-gen2-qwen-500m", trust_remote_code=True)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("unum-cloud/uform-gen2-qwen-500m", trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "Question or Instruction"
image = Image.open("image.jpg")

inputs = processor(text=[prompt], images=[image], return_tensors="pt")
with torch.inference_mode():
     output = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        do_sample=False,
        use_cache=True,
        max_new_tokens=256,
        eos_token_id=151645,
        pad_token_id=processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id
    )

prompt_len = inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]
decoded_text = processor.batch_decode(output[:, prompt_len:])[0]
```
