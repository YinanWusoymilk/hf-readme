# Qwen2-Audio-7B

## Introduction

Qwen2-Audio is the new series of Qwen large audio-language models. Qwen2-Audio is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. We introduce two distinct audio interaction modes:

* voice chat: users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input;

* audio analysis: users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction;

We release Qwen2-Audio-7B and Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, which are pretrained model and chat model respectively. 

For more details, please refer to our [Blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-audio/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-Audio), and [Report](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.10759).

## Requirements
The code of Qwen2-Audio has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`, or you might encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2-audio'
```

## Quickstart

Here provides offers a code snippet illustrating the process of loading both the processor and model, alongside detailed instructions on executing the pretrained Qwen2-Audio base model for content generation.


```python
from io import BytesIO
from urllib.request import urlopen
import librosa
from transformers import AutoProcessor, Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration

model = Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B" ,trust_remote_code=True)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B" ,trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "<|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>Generate the caption in English:"
url = "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Audio/glass-breaking-151256.mp3"
audio, sr = librosa.load(BytesIO(urlopen(url).read()), sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)
inputs = processor(text=prompt, audios=audio, return_tensors="pt")

generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256)
generated_ids = generated_ids[:, inputs.input_ids.size(1):]
response = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```
